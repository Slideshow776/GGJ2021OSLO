# Global Game Jam 2021, Oslo

This is a 2D endless runner.  You roll out of bed, in only your underpants, when you run you progressively find your clothes, while jumping and dodging stuff in your messy apartment. When you "die" you go to work in whatever clothes you managed to find. Can you make it to work (home office) fully clothed??
